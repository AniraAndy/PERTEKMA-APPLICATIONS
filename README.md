Description
This portal is centralized, web-based dashboard where it is designed to streamline the recruitment of the 2025/2026 Student Association committee. It replaces traditional, manual spreadsheet navigation with an interactive interface that allows the selection committee to search, filter, and review applicants efficiently. By consolidating data from multiple sources—including the Master Applicant List, Recommended Candidates, and Reapplying Members—the system provides a holistic view of every candidate, ensuring a fair and organized selection process.

Managing hundreds of student applications via raw Excel files is time-consuming and prone to oversight. Cross-referencing matric numbers, checking for previous experience, and verifying document status requires constant switching between multiple spreadsheets.

SOLUTION:
1. Instantly merges data from general applications and internal recommendations.
2. Find any student by name or matric number in milliseconds
3. Sort candidates by year of study, course or position to quickly identify gaps in the departments
4. View applicant profiles and download resumes with a single click

DATA INTEGRATION
1. Master Database (data.xlsx) - Primary repository containing all applicants details
2. Recommended List (recommended.xlsx) - Specialised dataset for candidates that is suggested by PERTEKMA, which the system automatically enriches with contact details from the Master Database.
3. Reapplicants List (reapplicants.xlsx) - For former committee members reapplying again for the next batch.
